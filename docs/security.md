# Security Overview

Security of a web3 protocol and a decentralized monitoring network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems is of utmost importance. Forta protects billions of dollars in the web3 ecosystem; Forta needs to be reliable and follow best security practices. Forta community members, including a16z, recently published a guide called [Smart Contract Security: A Simple Checklist for Web3 Development](https://a16zcrypto.com/smart-contract-security-checklist-web3-development/). It describes five critical phases of the Development Lifecycle for Smart Contract Security, which the Forta community followed when developing the Forta protocol:

This section shares how each of these 5 phases was contemplated in the development of the Forta Network. Forta should continue to approach security comprehensively, including contemplating network infrastructure and web2 dependent components (e.g. the Forta API and Dapp) and associated processes as the protocol evolves.

Security of a protocol is not static. A protocol continues to evolve and security issues can be introduced with any changes; attackers also evolve and may adopt techniques that represent new threats. The Forta communityâ€™s stance towards security therefore should not be static. Security should not degrade, but rather strengthen over time. This section also highlights the continued investments the Forta community can make over time to strengthen Forta's security, such as auditing any changes to existing smart contracts, ongoing monitoring and detection bot development, and periodic security assessments.

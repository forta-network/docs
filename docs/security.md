# Security Overview

Security of a web3 protocol and a decentralized monitoring network to detect threats and anomalies on DeFi, NFT, governance, bridges and other Web3 systems is of utmost importance. Forta protects billions of dollars in the web3 ecosystem; Forta needs to be reliable and follow best security practices. Forta community members recently collaborated with a16z publishing a guide on [Smart Contract Security: A Simple Checklist for Web3 Development](https://a16zcrypto.com/smart-contract-security-checklist-web3-development/). It describes five critical phases of the Development Lifecycle for Smart Contract Security, which Forta and the Forta community followed when developing the Forta protocol:

This section shares Forta's investments in each of these 5 phases. Forta approaches security comprehensively and encompasses also network infrastructure and web2 dependent components (e.g. the Forta API and Dapp) and associated processes.

Security of a protocol is not static. A protocol continues to evolve and security issues can be introduced with those changes; attackers also evolve and may adopt techniques that represent new threats. The Forta's community stance towards security therefore is also not static. Security should not degrade, but rather strengthen over time. This section also highlights the continued investments the Forta community is making over time to strengthen Forta's security, such as auditing any changes to existing smart contracts, ongoing monitoring and detection bot development, and periodic security assessments.

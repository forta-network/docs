## Security - Deployment

The Foundation has required deployment through GitHub CI and OpenZeppelin's Defender product. For off-chain assets, critical pull requests must go through a required review that upon the merge are gated by successful tests, node scanner software is gated through an state update in the ScannerNodeVersion contract, and smart contract deployments/changes are handled through OpenZeppelinâ€™s Defender product and relayers and are controlled by multisigs. This process ensures that the Forta Network cannot be changed,  even in the event of a security breach by an individual involved in any development processes.


### Multi-Sig
Forta is managed through three main Gnosis Safe Multi Sig contracts: 

- [0xC0eb11fBC755D31c6FECEaAc8760ddCb88C64fE1](https://etherscan.io/address/0xC0eb11fBC755D31c6FECEaAc8760ddCb88C64fE1) (Ethereum mainnet). 4/7 controlled by the [Council members](https://gov.forta.network/t/forta-proposal-permissionless-launch-fp-1/202/7)
- [0x30ceaeC1d8Ed347B91d45077721c309242db3D6d](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x30ceaeC1d8Ed347B91d45077721c309242db3D6d) (Polygon mainnet). 4/7 controlled by the [Council members](https://gov.forta.network/t/forta-proposal-permissionless-launch-fp-1/202/7)
- [0xd1d4FaFd400fCD643132bb7eAF7682eE97E09C3e](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd1d4FaFd400fCD643132bb7eAF7682eE97E09C3e) (Polygon mainnet). The Council members may delegate certain roles and corresponding signing authority. Currently, administrative roles have been delegated to a 4/6 multisig with members of the Foundation staff and certain members of the original core development team.

The Council multisigs have the following roles:

**Ethereum Mainnet**

- Forta Token (0x41545f8b9472D758bB669ed8EaEEEcD7a9C4Ec29): ADMIN_ROLE, MINTER_ROLE, WHITELISTER_ROLE
- Airdrop (0x988a7Bc24A9D0fa49989FB9734bDa30f55760cEb): DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, AIRDROP_MANAGER_ROLE, ADDITIONAL_CLAIM_MANAGER_ROLE, UPGRADER_ROLE

**Polygon Mainnet**

- Forta Token (Bridged) (0x9ff62d1FC52A907B6DCbA8077c2DDCA6E6a9d3e1): ADMIN_ROLE, WHITELISTER_ROLE, MINTER_ROLE
- Access (0x107Ac13567b1b5D84691f890A5bA07EdaE1a11c3): SLASHER_ROLE, UPGRADER_ROLE, AGENT_ADMIN_ROLE, ROUTER_ADMIN_ROLE, ENS_MANAGER_ROLE, SCANNER_VERSION_ROLE

The administrative multisig has the following roles:

**Polygon Mainnet**

- Access (0x107Ac13567b1b5D84691f890A5bA07EdaE1a11c3): SLASHER_ROLE, UPGRADER_ROLE, AGENT_ADMIN_ROLE, ROUTER_ADMIN_ROLE, ENS_MANAGER_ROLE, SWEEPER_ROLE, SCANNER_VERSION_ROLE, DISPATCHER_ROLE
The council member multisigs have the following roles:

### Contract Administration
Forta contracts are managed through [OpenZeppelin's Defender product](https://defender.openzeppelin.com/) utilizing relays to manage smart contract deployment and maintenance.

### Forta On-Chain Monitoring
Forta on-chain activity is monitored by [Forta Detection Bots](https://app.forta.network/agents/forta) and feeds into Forta Network's incident response process. The following detection bots were developed specifically for the Forta smart contracts. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/LimeChain/forta-bots).

Forta is also monitored by the bots in the [Threat Detection Kits](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/threat-detection-kits/).

### Forta Off-Chain Monitoring
Lastly, several operational monitors exist around the performance of the network, such as latency, API usage, deployments, etc.

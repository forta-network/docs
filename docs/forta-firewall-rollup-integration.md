# Pre-sequencer screening for Rollups

Forta Firewall integrates directly with rollup infrastructure to block malicious and non-compliant transactions before they reach the sequencer.

Forta Firewall integrates with rollup infrastructure to screen transactions before they reach the sequencer. High-risk or non-compliant activity is automatically flagged and can be blocked in real time preventing execution of malicious or unwanted transactions.

This is made possible through direct integrations with popular Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers, including:

Conduit

Gelato

Quicknode

Alchemy

Zeeve

If your rollup uses another RaaS provider or a custom implementation, you can contact the Forta Foundation for custom integrations.

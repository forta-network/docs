# Compliance Screening

Forta Firewall enables real-time compliance enforcement by screening all transactions before they reach the chain thanks to its position upstream of the sequencer.

Firewall can block or delay transactions that violate compliance rules based on:

- OFAC-sanctioned addresses
- Custom jurisdictional or industry-specific policies
- Custom whitelists or blacklists

By integrating directly into the transaction flow, Firewall ensures that sanctioned or non-compliant activity is filtered out before execution. Rollups and protocols can define their own rulesets or adopt global standards, enabling flexible enforcement tailored to their regulatory needs.

This makes Forta Firewall a powerful tool for maintaining compliance without sacrificing decentralization or speed.

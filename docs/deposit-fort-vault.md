2. After connecting your wallet, navigate to the **stake** button on the top of the Forta App. Here you can deposit your FORT tokens into the vault.

## Withdrawing from the FORT Token Vault and Claiming Rewards

Initiating a withdrawal request from the FORT Vault will result in a percentage amount of FORT returned to you at the time of withdrawal based on the availability of liquidity in the vault. To claim the remaining FORT, you must wait the **10 day cooling off period** to initiate a withdrawal transaction for the remainder of your FORT tokens. 

Rewards are automatically included in your total FORT deposit amount and will continue to grow.

## Security - Maintenance

As mentioned in the overview, security is not static and Forta development community is periodically assessing the change velocity and risk assessment. A standing agenda item to review/ assess the state of the network from a security perspective is part of the monthly core dev meeting.

Forta has instituted an incident response process. While incidents can be categorized into normal, incidents, and emergency events, this section focuses on the latter as an extreme case. The processes and structure applied here can selectively flow into the former types of incidents. Of course, all the actions described in this security section could be described as preventative actions, incidents do occur and at the start of the incident one requires detective actions, such as operational and security monitoring, as well as communitiy engagement and communication channels (e.g. [@FortaNetwork](https://twitter.com/FortaNetwork) and [Forta Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fortanetwork)). When incidents occur, incident readiness and ability to take corrective actions are needed. While the incident process describes roles, responsibilities and actions to take during an incident, incident readiness needs to facilitate the action plan associated with the objectives set out for the incident response process. This includes aspects like defining communication channels, having the right audit trails, having capabilities to respond to an incident swiftly (e.g. pausing or updating a smart contract).  

### Incident Response Framework
The Forta Incident Response process is modeled after the FEMA National Incident Management System (NIMS). It is a standardized approach used by US government agencies to incident management that translates well into the cybersecurity space. Itâ€™s been used for over 40 years as an effective framework to effectively handle incidents. NIMS  is organized into three key components and gets activated when an incident occurs:
- **Resource Management**
- **Command and Coordination** - including the Incident Command System
- **Communications and Information Management**

The Incident Command System (ICS) is just one part of NIMS. The benefit of ICMs are:
- Clarifying chain of command and supervision responsibilities to improve accountability.
- Leveraging interoperable communications systems and plain language to improve communications.
- Providing an orderly, systematic planning process.
- Implementing a common, flexible, predesigned management structure.
- Fostering cooperation between diverse disciplines and agencies.

ICS is based on the following characteristics that contribute to the overall effectiveness and strengths of the system:
- **Common Terminology** - use common terminology that can be understood by a broad range of stakeholders.
- **Modular Organization** - to scale up/down pending the size of the incidents; this is particularly important in cases where incidents impact distributed teams and protocols and broader coordination is needed.
- **Management by Objectives** - clearly define and communicate the objectives regarding the incident.
- **Incident Action Planning** - describes the actions that need to be taken and by whom to accomplish the objectives.
- **Manageable Span of Control** - ensure that an accountable person is able to manage the resources assigned effectively by limiting cohorts to 5 people that report up the chain of command.
- **Incident Facilities and Locations** - establishes incident command posts; in case of cybersecurity, this would be representative of a war room.
- **Comprehensive Resource Management** - establish process to obtain resources needed to achieve the objectives.
- **Integrated Communications** - establishes situational awareness, maintain connectivity and facilitate information sharing with stakeholders (e.g. Forta council, protocols, Forta community).
- **Establishment and Transfer of Command** - ensure an appropriate hand off to incident commanders given an incident extends a longer duration incidents.
- **Unified Command** - an optional structure of an incident command team with clear roles/responsibilities if the incident commander is not able to fulfill these functions themselves. In case of Forta incident command, it is recommended to have a unified command that consists of incident command supervisor and public information officer.
- **Chain of Command and Unity of Command** - hierarchy around the chain of command with a single supervisor to ensure alignment of incident responders with the objectives and effective communication channels.
- **Accountability** - accountability across the action plan items assigned to incident responders, clear chain of command, span of control, and checkin/checkout procedures.
- **Dispatch/Deployment** - incidents may require specific resources/ experts to accomplish the objectives. Definition of a process to acquire these resources.
- **Information and Intelligence Management** - similar to resources, information are a key component to accomplishing the objectives. Definition on how the information is managed and stored.

While this appears to be a complex and ridget system, it is the opposite of that. It is a simple flexible framework that creates clarity in an incident situation. For more information around NIMS and ICS, the following online training courses provide more details: [IS-100.c](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-100.c) and [IS-700.b](https://training.fema.gov/is/courseoverview.aspx?code=IS-700.b).

### Practice
Incident response processes can be stressful events. Similar on how fire drills are practiced in school, practicing incident response processes will help to surface gaps in the process, get everybody familiar with the process, and help everybody to be more comfortable and effective in a real world incident. 
 
The Forta community will simulate an incident every 6 months if no other real world incidents occurred and post results of the incidents in a post-mortem write up. These will be scheduled events.

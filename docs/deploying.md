# Deploying your bot

Once you have tested your bot locally, you are ready to deploy it to the Forta network production environment! Deploying your bot involves 3 key steps:

1. publishing a Docker image
2. registering it in the Bot Registry smart contract
3. staking 100 FORT tokens on your bot

## Acquiring Polygon POL tokens

The Bot Registry smart contract currently lives on Polygon mainnet, so you will need **POL tokens on Polygon mainnet** in order to deploy your bot. You can acquire some POL tokens by following [this guide](matic.md).

## Using Forta App vs CLI

You can choose to [deploy using Forta App](deploying-app.md) or [deploy using the CLI tool](deploying-cli.md). You may want to use the CLI tool, for example, in your CI/CD pipeline.

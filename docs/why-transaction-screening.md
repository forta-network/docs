## Why Transaction Screening?

The transaction screening approach is more effective at preventing exploits than other methods, such as auto-pausing contracts because:

- **Total Visibility:** It has total visibility into pending transactions (even transactions submitted via private channels).
- **No Dependency on Speed:** It doesnâ€™t depend on being faster than the attacker.

Regardless of how the exploit is submitted (public or private mempools), and how efficient it is (atomic vs. multiple transactions), it must pass through the Firewall before it can be executed.

# _Use Forta_


### **What can Forta be used for?**

The Forta Network monitors on-chain activity in real-time, detecting threats, security-related events and other noteworthy activity. The network is made up of thousands of detection bots developed by a community of Web3 developers and security experts. Each bot acts like a little security camera monitoring something specific on-chain. Some bots monitor generic threats (i.e. phishing attacks, rug pulls), and others monitor protocol-specific activity (i.e. Lido, Compound).

The output from all this monitoring and detection is what we call _threat intelligence_ - data that tells you the “who, what, when, where and how” about threats and security events.   

Users can access threat intel generated by any bot on the network. Certain bots the community feels are particularly high value have been packaged up into _Premium Feeds_, like the Scam Detector. Premium Feeds are owned and maintained by one or more reputable community members (teams and/or individuals) and must meet certain requirements for performance and precision. The price for each Premium Feed is set by the owner. Intel from the other bots on the network can be accessed under the network’s General subscription plan option.

You can see all the Premium Feeds [here](https://app.forta.network/). You can also browse the 1,000+ other bots on the network [here](https://app.forta.network/).

Intel from Premium Feeds and individual bots can be accessed either through Forta’s GraphQL API (pull) or by subscribing to a bot directly (push) to receive notifications via email, Slack, or Telegram, among other options. Purchasing one or more network subscriptions allows you to access both options. 

### **Who uses Forta?**

## _General_





### **What are detection bots?**

Detection bots refer to a set of code scripts within a Docker container that process some blockchain data (i.e. a block or transaction) and detect specific threat conditions (e.g. whether a flash loan attack occurred, or whether a particular account balance fell below some threshold). Bots are executed by scan nodes, and emit alerts for their findings. 

### **What are scan nodes?**

A scan node executes detection bots for every transaction and every new block on a specific blockchain network. The scan node manages and coordinates bots (e.g. by instantiating and running bots, and restarting bots that become unresponsive). The scan node ferries blockchain data to bots to process the transaction/block. 

### **How does Forta ensure reliable monitoring?**

The Forta Network combines different approaches to ensure reliable monitoring. Firstly, scan nodes must produce a proof of scan for every block, so performance is measured continuously and an SLA score is calculated at all times. If SLA score is below an accepted threshold, the node stops receiving rewards and detection bots get unassigned from it. In addition, each bot is assigned and gets run by multiple nodes. This redundancy ensures that even if one node is not performing correctly, the others will. Additionally, for those detection bots that are very resource intensive and may not be handled well by a node, sharding can be enabled to shard the bot and have it be executed partially on different nodes. Finally, nodes have staking requirements, and can be slashed if found to be acting maliciously. This, as well as the effect of low SLA on rewards, represents an economic incentive for nodes to have good performance.

### **How are Forta findings validated?**

Forta scan nodes gather findings from detection bots for each block and then store a proof of scan on IPFS and broadcast the finding details to the Forta analyzer node. Users can obtain the detailed information from the Forta analyzer node via the public API, which can be validated against the proof of scan data on IPFS. The analyzer node performs data indexing and may provide additional analysis.

### **What chains does Forta support?**

Forta supports monitoring on the following chains: Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism and Fantom.

### **What machine learning techniques are being used in Forta?**

The community of data scientists and developers in the Forta Network have created multiple detection bots that use advanced machine learning techniques for detection. These include deep learning, supervised classification, anomaly detection, time series anomaly detection, and clustering, among others. You can learn more about how machine learning is being used in the Forta Network [here](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/ml-with-forta/).

### **Is Forta a blockchain?**

Short answer: no. Forta is not a blockchain in the sense that it does not maintain a shared state between nodes, but it has similar characteristics to a blockchain in that it is a decentralized network of nodes. Forta is more similar to The Graph protocol in that it runs on top of a blockchain. Forta uses a blockchain (i.e. Polygon) to coordinate scan nodes and store IPFS references to alerts generated by bots.

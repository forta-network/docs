# Get Started

## What is a starter kit?

If you are new to Forta, a starter kit will help you get started on monitoring and protecting Web3 projects and assets right away with little to no technical and security experience.

A starter kit consists of security detection bots and bot templates created and curated by the Forta community and security experts.

There are currently 4 starter kits available, each specifically tailored to monitor different parts of the Web3 ecosystem and detect threats.

* [Bridge Starter Kit](bridge-starter-kit.md)
* [DeFi Starter Kit](defi-starter-kit.md)
* [NFT Starter Kit](nft-starter-kit.md)
* [Stablecoin Starter Kit](stablecoin-starter-kit.md)

## (WIP) How to subscribe to starter kit detection bots?

For each starter kit, security experts hand-picked a list of detection bots users can subscribe to to help identify a broad range of security related events. By subscribing to these bots, you can receive alerts on suspicious and/or anomalous activities potentially occuring at any stage of an ongoing web3 attack. To learn more about how web3 attacks happen and how Forta can mitigate them, check out the [Forta illuminates the Web3 Kill Chain Blog Post](https://forta.org/blog/web3-kill-chain/).

// TODO - update instructions once UI is updated.

1. To subscribe, first visit the [Forta App](https://app.forta.network/).

## (WIP) What are detection bot templates? How does it work?

Each starter kit may also include detection bot templates. The bot templates allow users to quickly customize, create, and deploy bots without developing one from scratch.

Non-technical users can configure and create their own detection bots without touching any code via the bot wizard interface.

TODO - how to access the bot wizard

Developers can also get access to security detection bot and template source code to fork, customize, and contribute.

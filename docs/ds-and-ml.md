## Sources for Training Data and Labels

Do you see any missing resource the community can use below? Contribute to [the docs](https://github.com/forta-network/docs).

### Blockchain Data

* [Luabase](https://luabase.com) - Query blockchain data with [SQL](https://luabase.notion.site/2067e9caa29448ccafe729518cf67ea6?v=a370577950c0407f939df3fa7362daff&p=230bedd0413846ab84d6fea6c6aab44c&pm=s) and request data in real-time via an [API](https://luabase.notion.site/2067e9caa29448ccafe729518cf67ea6?v=a370577950c0407f939df3fa7362daff&p=0bf87e362d9645d2bc2d9876cc549a72&pm=s).
* [BigQuery Public Blockchain Datasets](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/public-datasets) - Available to query using BigQuery on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/free).
* [Ethereum ETL](https://ethereum-etl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Tool to convert blockchain data into CSV formats and relational databases.
* [Transaction event](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/python/#transactionevent) and [block event](https://docs.forta.network/en/latest/python/#blockevent) is available in Forta Bot Container. You can also collect training data on the fly and train periodically like this [Re-entrancy on Uniswap Time Series Bot](https://explorer.forta.network/bot/0x1e3ec10394a46d44ec0802f9e27162236cd61a1f7c13767f0c9ada7b48def6ae)

### Labels

* [Luabase address tags + labels](https://luabase.notion.site/Tags-521d6955dc1e472ba37dba71569666a3) - Addresses with etherscan labels `exploit`, `heist`, and `phish-hack` are available.
* [EtherScamDB](https://github.com/CryptoScamDB/EtherScamDB) - Open-source db that keeps track of ethereum scams and involved addresses.
* [Forta API](https://github.com/forta-network/forta-api) - Query critical alerts via the Forta API and use them as [weak labels](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/insights/blog/data-science-and-analytics/weak-labeling).
* [web3rekt.com](https://www.web3rekt.com/) - Query known blockchain incidents and scams.


## Historical Alerts Access

Thereâ€™s a unique opportunity for the community to take advantage of the open data and collaborate on new data science and machine learning solutions together. For example, the community can begin to extract trends and insights from historical alerts that may be helpful to improving blockchain security. And with the right tools and data, Forta can also begin to detect threats and exploits before they happen with increasing accuracy over time.

Do you need access to historical alerts soon for data analysis or for your bot? If so, check out [Forta API](api.md).

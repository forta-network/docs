# Example Use Cases

The Forta API will allow protocols, DAOs, investors, and the community to integrate alerts in dApps and tools.
There are many use cases for this, but here are three examples to give you a better idea how this API can be used. 

## 1. Strengthen Protocol Security

**As a protocol developer...**

Let’s say you developed an agent that monitors critical events on the protocol, but the agent has been emitting a lot of noisy alerts. 
To reduce noisy alerts, you can:

1. Query the API for past alerts
2. Analyze your agent’s alerting rate
3. Tweak alerting threshold or logic

Or you can also develop more complex mitigation scripts that:

1. Query the API for specific agents’ alerts
2. Automate smart contract operations based on the received alerts

## 2. Reduce Phishing Attacks

**As a dApp developer**, you can:

1. Notify users of potential threats and governance changes in the dApp. 
2. Build out an extension to wallets like Metamask to display warnings about a particular wallet address or smart contracts users are about to interact with.
3. Build a smart contract safety checker tool.

This is all possible by querying the API for alerts across agents that are associated with specific wallets and/or smart contracts at different points in time. 

## 3. Make Informed Financial Decisions

**As a financial analyst**, you may want to analyze several blockchain projects’ alerts and identify trends before making any investment decisions.

**As an insurance protocol**, you can decide whether to provide coverage or process claims for a particular smart contract by analyzing its alerts to gauge its security.

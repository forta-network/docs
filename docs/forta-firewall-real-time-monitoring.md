# Real Time Monitoring

Because Forta Firewall screens every transaction before it's executed it enables a powerful layer of real-time monitoring across the entire transaction surface of a rollup or protocol.

This visibility allows developers, security teams, and infrastructure providers to detect abnormal behavior as it happens, not after the fact.

Firewall can surface signals across four critical vectors:

- Market anomalies: Detects sudden price movements, abnormal volume spikes, or unexpected token mints that may indicate manipulation or depegs.

- Infrastructure integrity: Flags irregularities in bridges and oracles, such as feed deviations, latency, or stale data that could lead to incorrect execution.

- Governance changes: Monitors unexpected multisig ownership shifts or suspicious governance proposals that could signal insider threats or hostile takeovers.

- Security threats: Provides early detection of key theft, unauthorized contract upgrades, or the deployment of malicious contracts.

By catching these events before they impact the chain, Forta Firewall shifts response from reactive to proactive, giving users time to act while the window is still open.
